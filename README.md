# classRoster Program
This program maintains a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program include student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree program. 


#### Required User Stories
Demonstrate the programâ€™s required functionality by adding a main() function in main.cpp, which will contain the required function calls to achieve the following results:

1.  Print out to the screen, via your application, the course title, the programming language used, ID, and name.

2.  Create an instance of the Roster class called classRoster.

3.  Add each student to classRoster.

4.  Convert the following pseudo code to complete the rest of the  main() function:

a.  classRoster.printAll();

b.  classRoster.printInvalidEmails();

c.  //loop through classRosterArray and for each element:

d.  classRoster.printAverageDaysInCourse(/*current_object's student id*/);

e.  classRoster.printByDegreeProgram(SOFTWARE);

f.  classRoster.remove("A3");

g.  classRoster.printAll();

h.  classRoster.remove("A3");

i.  //expected: the above line should print a message saying such a student with this ID was not found.

5.  Implement the destructor to release the memory that was allocated dynamically in Roster.

6.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of the program.
